# Psychic-Telegram - Version 2.0 Of My Personal Startpage

This is a revamped version of my first homepage. This new ones takes what was originally there and gets rid of half the junk, for a more quick and fluid experience, not to mention this one works.

# Pre Requisites:

- It is reccomended that you simply take the Github Pages URL of this repository and use it yourself, however, your needs and frequently visited sites will probably differ from mine. If so you will have to host the site on your own Github Account with Pages (you can find out how to do that **[Here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages "GitHub Pages Docs")**) or host though another provider.

- For Mozilla FireFox, Google Chrome or most other Chromium based browsers, you will need to install a browser extension, that will allow you to use custom URL's for new tabs. Instalation for other browsers such as IE, Microsoft Edge and Opera may vary.

- Get it **[here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/ "FireFox Extension")** for FireFox,
- **[Here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-override/fjcmlondipcnnpmbcollgifldmajfonf?hl=en-GB "Chrome Extension")** for Google Chrome (Or any Chromium based browser such as Brave,)
- As far as I know, this extension is not available on the Safari Browser
